## üîß How It Works

### AI Voice Agent Workflow
1. **Recording**: User clicks "Start Voice Query" and speaks their question into microphone
2. **Audio Capture**: Browser's MediaRecorder API captures audio with real-time timer
3. **Processing Feedback**: Visual step-by-step progress shows:
   - Transcribing audio using AssemblyAI
   - Analyzing question with AI
   - Generating response with Google Gemini
   - Creating speech with Murf AI
4. **AI Processing**: FastAPI backend processes the complete pipeline:
   - Speech-to-text conversion via AssemblyAI
   - Smart prompt engineering for Markdown-formatted responses
   - AI response generation via Google Gemini (configurable model)
   - Text-to-speech conversion via Murf AI
5. **Rich Display**: Results shown with:
   - Original transcription of user's question
   - AI response with full Markdown rendering (lists, code, tables, etc.)
   - Natural voice audio playback of the response
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for various scenarios
